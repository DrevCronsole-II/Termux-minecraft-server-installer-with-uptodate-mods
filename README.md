# Termux-minecraft-server-installer
#### **!INSTALLATION GUIDE IS IN THE WIKI SECTION OF THIS GITHUB!**

## Current: v1.19.4

This is a simple script (originally designed for Termux) that will automatically install and configure a vanilla-optimized Quilt server for Minecraft Java (and in the future hopefully, Bedrock.)
You can add any Fabric or Quilt mod you want.

`I had an example of this running on my own android device; a Modded Survival experience. It's no longer up though and I instead host a MCPi server now. github.com/MCPI-Revival` !!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Thanks to these things/people that made it possible !
> MC v1.19.2 - Synced server package manifest to client, updating the Netty framework to a version that makes this code work

> Quilt Mod Loader - Best solution for hosting MC servers imo (for personal use)

> Quilt Mod Loader Discord - Very cool people and devs helped me find compalibility issues

> The Mods - Lithium, FerriteCore, ViaFabric, ViaBackwards, ViaRewind, Starlight, qfapi *(fabric library implementation + Quilt library from Quilt)*, Fabrictailor *(to change skins, do /skin)*, Clumps, C2ME, memoryleakfix, smoothchunk, LazyDFU, smoothboot, VMP, recipecache, quiltgofast, getittogetherdrops, fabric carpet, dim-thread, carpet extras, BadPackets, alternate current, advdebug.

> Sukiru - they're like a java dev or something, they were useful with answering my very urgent and serious questions.

### ⚠️ This guide assumes you are runnning a supported operating system.  ⚠️
The steps are in the Wiki section of this github repo inorder to reduce clutter here. Feedback is appriciated, my discord is Theslees#1162 if you need to reach out.


Please check if your system is compatible with this script before running it;

### ***Fedora-based, Debian-based, Arch Linux-based, Alpine-based, Termux.***

# To do
- Add Windows support in a different branch
- ~~Geyser support~~ removed geyser due to floodgate not working here, and to make this script minimal.
- ~~More Distros~~
- ~~Use functions to make it easier to read ig~~
- ~~Native Termux Support (remove the need for AnLinux.)~~
- In the wiki, make the linux section a single step using a universal command everyone can run to get the script up and going. Or something
